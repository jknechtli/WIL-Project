          Below is a summary about resumes and why it is important to have an
          exceptional resume on hand at anytime.
          <h3>Why do you need a resume?</h3>
          ​ When applying for jobs it is important for a recruiter to have an
          idea of who you are as a person and your work history in a
          professional and personalised manner. Therefore a well written resume
          explains your best characteristics, such as your work ethics, your
          skills, your past work employment, your achievements and any other
          personal assets which would be beneficial to a prospective employer.
          Additionally a well written resume gives you the ability to present
          yourself in the most positive and professional light and allows you
          the opportunity to sell yourself based on merit. A resume therefore is
          almost like a written sales document justifying to employer why they
          should give you the opportunity to present for a job interview. What
          employers look for in a resume? ​ Employers are delighted to see a
          professional, positive and thoughtful resume that is easy to read and
          understand making their screening process easier. Employers value
          resumes which are well formatted, utilise simple yet effective
          language and make sense with plain English, Employers appreciate a
          resume which is tailored to specific positions to assess whether you
          are the perfect match for a position through your qualifications,
          skills and history of employment and other activities. Employers also
          value a resume which is succinct, honest and aesthetically appealing.
          Overall the ambition of an employer is to find the right employee at
          the right time for the right position, therefore a resume which
          matches these requirements will achieve a greater chance at an
          interview. ​

          <h3>10 quick resume tips</h3>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Most recruiters are attracted to resumes that standout, some
              examples may include bright coloured headers, or perfume scented
              paper.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ensure that you write down not only your qualifications but also
              where you have demonstrated your passion for this career choice
              through work experience or volunteer work.
            </li>
            <li>
              Presenting yourself in a positive light is best when writing a
              resume, recruiters don't want to see any negative or self-doubt
              presented in your resume.
            </li>
            <li>
              Don't be afraid to be different, if you feel as though including a
              hobby project that is relevant to the position, include it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Honesty is very important for resume writing as you want to sound
              credible and give the employer the impression that you would be a
              reliable asset to their work environment.
            </li>
            <li>
              Its important to provide at least two references, you don't want
              to leave your potential employer wondering who to contact on your
              resume.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ensure you are applying for jobs that match your career and
              personality, as this gives you an opportunity to make use of your
              skills and experiences in a way that benefits yourself as well as
              the employer.
            </li>
            <li>
              Its important to address all criteria outlined in a job
              advertisement as employers use this as a screening process to find
              the most suitable person for the position.
            </li>
            <li>
              Do not include humour in your resume, it is a professional
              document and jokes are not appropriate and you may end up
              offending the recruiter.
            </li>
            <li>
              Including your extracurricular activities such as scuba diving or
              reading are important to put on your resume as it allows for the
              recruiter to get an idea of how you spend your time outside of the
              work environment.
            </li>
          </ol>
