          <p>
            Exceptional Tuition and Resumes was proudly founded by award winning
            Gold Coast entrepreneur, academic, HR professional and careers
            speaker, Monique Jeremiah in 2010. As a relationship and results
            driven professional with an undeniable passion for education and
            employment, Monique started the company in order to help university
            students and jobseekers to achieve a competitive advantage in the
            employment market. Coming from a family of nurses and well-educated
            professionals, she recognised the need to develop a resume writing
            service dedicated to helping nurses, university and RTO graduates
            and construction workers to promote themselves effectively and
            achieve a well written employment application. With a community
            driven spirit, Monique also highly values the skills of nurses and
            construction workers and what they bring to society. Equipped with a
            Bachelor of Business (majoring in human resources and industrial
            relations), a Certificate IV in Training and Assessment, a
            Certificate IV in Small Business Management and a qualification in
            OHS, Monique is dedicated to helping every jobseeker to achieving
            exceptional results professionally. During her professional career
            Monique worked as an academic tutor, business trainer and employment
            writer at various universities and vocational education companies
            within the business, employment relations department and
            multicultural divisions, along with working in the IBM human capital
            management division in Australia and overseas and managing several
            small businesses. Throughout her high school years, she won the top
            academic award of DUX in both 2009 and 2010 and was an academic
            scholarship winner. As a result, Monique truly understands the
            common and daunting challenges faced by university students and
            jobseekers and therefore leads the team of resume writers at
            Exceptional Tuition and Resumes with the determination to help every
            jobseeker achieve a quality employment application.
