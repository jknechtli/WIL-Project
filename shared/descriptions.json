This course is necessary for international students as it is overseen by the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia, and is vital in making international students feel more comfortable and confident about working as a Nurse in Australia  Nursing FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) What is Nursing? Nursing is a profession in the healthcare industry that focuses on providing different types of care to vulnerable, injured, old, and/or disabled people in the country. Even healthy people would likely need a Nurse at least once in their life, such as for even a minor hospital procedure. While Nurses are similar to doctors, Nurses focus more on encouraging the healing of patients by physically supporting them through tasks they may not be able to do themselves. Nursing has a stronger focus on empathy and doctors have a stronger focus on supporting their prescriptions or treatment plans with scientific research. Nursing is a good choice for people who like to spend their time helping people in need, as this can greatly improve the quality of life for anyone requiring frequent or daily help.  Nurses also have flexible choices when it comes to settings they can work in, such as aged care homes, hospitals, specialist clinics, prisons, homes, and general practices.  Why is Australia so popular for Nursing courses? Australia is a very safe country with a number of prestigious universities. Our Nursing courses and programs have been developed and refined through decades of developments in both nursing and society in general. Australia has one of the best healthcare systems in the world, providing affordable public and private health treatments for almost all who live here.  Due to this fact that Australia’s healthcare system is quite advanced, more nurses are needed to sustain this view of our healthcare being so highly regarded. To encourage more Australians and especially internationally students to study Nursing, most Nursing occupations can be found in the Skilled Occupations List. Migration options for international students such as Permanent Residency can be fast-tracked and is generally a much easier process for those who study a Nursing course in Australia. This is one of the main reasons Nursing is so popular among international students studying in Australia.  The Bridging Program for Nurses is another incentive for previously experienced international nurses to continue their Nursing career but by moving to Australia. These bridging programs generally last only 3-6 months and can help international Nurses feel confident about working as a Nurse in Australia, where procedures may be different compared to their home country. This can include differences such as general Nursing conduct, legal responsibilities, safety issues, and the English language level required to be competent as a Nurse in Australia.  Most international students are legally allowed to work a maximum of 20 hours per week, and this is generally plenty for those who are trying to settle into life and work in Australia.  Lastly, a general but major reason why Australia attracts so many international students is due to our unique culture, environments, and lifestyle. Australia typically has a very relaxed feel and atmosphere. We have beautiful beaches, bustling cities, snowy mounts, and everything in between. Also, most of the major cities have great weather for the majority of the year.  What are the typical entry requirements for Nursing courses in Australia? Here are some of the most important requirements for international students to receive a student visa so they can study in Australia.  A valid passport for the entire length of your study in Australia An offer letter from the university or institution you hope to study at in Australia IELTS score 7 overall or OET B. These requirements can be slightly lower or higher depending on where exactly you want to study. Proof that you can afford to pay for your course in Australia Evidence of Australian Student Health Insurance successfully completed a secondary school qualification equivalent to Australian Year 12. Please contact us if you have more specific questions about course requirements or are unsure of your current eligibility.  Recognition of Prior Learning and Credits  If you have studied Nursing or a similar degree in another country, it is possible that you may be eligible for credit for the Nursing course you want to study in Australia. If this is true for you, then you may be able to complete a Nursing course sooner than expected and can also reduce course costs.",
