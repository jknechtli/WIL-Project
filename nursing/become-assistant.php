        <h3> How to apply for an AIN job </h3>
        <p>
          Being an AIN is a fundamental healthcare job in Australia. You can be an AIN in all states in Australia and is highly influenced by a jobseekers’ communication and care abilities because you are not only required to communicate with patients but also communicate with their families and professional doctors. You should also have a strong ability of tolerating unhygienic situations and mess because you will spend a lot of time dealing with patients’ waste and vomitus. Becoming an AIN is often a starting point for many nurse’s careers. It is a great entry point to becoming a future enrolled nurse or registered nurse in future.
        </p>
        <h3> Study to become an assistant in nursing in Australia as an international student </h3>
        <p>
          Many international students become an AIN as part of their nursing career as it a fairly easy entry level nursing job to apply and enter into if English is your second language. You will commonly be employed in aged care facilities and nursing homes and will work with more senior nurses. It is expected that you will complete a Certificate III in Health Assistance as a minimum prior to becoming an AIN.
        </p>
        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>
          It is significant that many AIN will be required to work overtime and late nights. In some situations, you may also have to work on weekends and holidays. It is an expectation that you may need to adjust to this kind of shift work to prevent yourself from burn out and exhaustion. As you will be often dealing with the elderly you may be dealing with residents / clients who are in bad moods, carrying negative thinking, poor memory and geriatric behaviour. They may also be patients who may be suffering from huge pain and loss. Therefore it is important to be compassionate, understanding and treat all with kindness and care. Additionally being an international students you may face a culture gap between Australia and your home country during your work.
        </p>
        <h3>Salary</h3>
