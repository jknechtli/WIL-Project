          At Exceptional Study Australia we specialise in writing graduate nursing resumes and cover letters for students nurses who have recently studied to be an assistant in nursing (AIN), enrolled nurse (EN) or registered nurse (RN) in Australia. Many university graduates and RTO students are choosing to study nursing as it is a stable and well demanded career across Australia and internationally. However, it is very important to stand out as a nursing graduate as there are thousands of nurses completing a Diploma of Nursing, Bachelor of Nursing or similar nursing qualification in Australia each year. As a nursing graduate you must therefore become more competitive when applying for a nursing graduate program or nursing position in a private health practice, private health organization or nursing agency. At Exceptional Study Australia we will make you stand out as a nurse.
