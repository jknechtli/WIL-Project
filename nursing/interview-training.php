        <h2>INTERVIEW TRAINING FOR NURSES</h2>
        <p>
          At Exceptional Study Australia we offer one on one interview training for nurses that have achieved an interview in a hospital, nursing agency or other healthcare organisation. Our one off session will last normally around 1.5 hours and can be conducted from the comfort of your home online. Using Skype, we can run a mock interview based on the job you have applied for to help you prepare from start to finish of your interview. As experienced recruiters we will take the role of an interviewer, recruiter or human resource manager, develop a set of interview questions and ask you to consider and respond to appropriate selection criteria or competencies. You will have asked a series of questions to demonstrate that your skills and abilities relate to standards or abilities your employer would be expected to ask you on the day of your actual interview. These questions may include behaviour-based questions and hypothetical questions. The purpose of the interview is to validate and build on the answers you have given in your written application. The questions we will ask in interviews will be based on the same criteria as the health care organization you are interviewing for.

          As nursing positions have very strict requirements for professional knowledge, we will ask you to demonstrate your knowledge, provide plenty of examples and test your confidence as a nurse. Our goal is to help you as a nurse to succeed in your nursing job interview and be able to answer any question in a calm, strong and confident manner.
