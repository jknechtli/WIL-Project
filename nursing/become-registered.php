Beside the linguistic requirements of completing their IELTS test and meeting the minimal IELTS score, registered nurse also need to remember and use plenty of professional medical and clinical terminology during their work time. Also, they may experience different medical environments and requirements in Australia from their home countries. Therefore they need to adjust to these kinds of differences during their studying process of their Bachelor degrees.</p>         <h3>Challenges</h3>         <p>The work of a registered nurse can be quite different and mixed which depends on what kind of patients they are dealing with. Registered nurses often engage in shift work and are expected to work long periods of time. They may also need to work night shift or weekend work which can present social challenges if balancing work and family life. Sometimes more ambitious registered nurses may become a nursing leader, therefore with leadership comes a huge pressure and responsibility to make decisions relating with patients’ lives. Also, they may have to decide which field they wish to work in further while they are working. Therefore as professional development is an important element of the career of a registered nurse it can be expected that registered nurses will need to undertake ongoing study, short courses and inhouse education training to further their skills. Therefore an openness to learning would be expected. Additionally all registered nurses can expect to be challenged with various patients, team members and high pressure circumstances, therefore all actions should be taken with a high ethical and moral standard at all times. Patients and their welfare must always be made a priority and emotions sometimes need to be left at the door as a registered nurse.</p>         <h3> Salary </h3>         <p>The most common annual salary in Australia for registered nurses is generally between 65k AUD to 75k AUD. However if you train and specialize in other clinical fields, you can expect the salary to be higher in some employers and depending if you work in private or public healthcare organisations.</p>       </div><?php include '../shared/enquiries.html'; ?>     </div>     <div class="footer"><?php include '../shared/footer.html'; ?></div>   </div> </body><?php include '../shared/script.html'; ?>  </html>
