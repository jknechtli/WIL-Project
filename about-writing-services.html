          <h3>About our Resumes</h3>
          <p>
            When applying for a position, the first and most important document
            which grabs the attention of an employer is your resume. It is a
            must-have tool for summarising your employment history, career
            intentions, education and what you bring to a profession and
            employer. Our professional resume writers aim to give you that
            competitive edge by marketing you especially for the job you want
            and only including the information which future employers will want
            to read about you. Our resumes are highly targeted, key word rich
            and aim to position you very carefully for the nursing position or
            construction job you are applying for. In terms of structure, our
            nursing resumes and construction resumes have a title page along
            with normally 3 to 4 pages of content. If you require a 2 page
            resume, please let us know as we will create the resume suitable for
            the job you want.
          </p>
          <h3>About our Cover Letters</h3>
          <p>
            When applying for a position it is essential for a professionally
            written cover letter to accompany your highly valuable resume. It is
            a must-have tool for telling employers which position/s you are
            applying for and why you should be given an interview. Our cover
            letter writers aim to write you a highly personalised and effective
            cover letter which sets you apart from other job candidates and
            shows employers you are interested in the job.
          </p>
          <h3>About our Suitability Statements</h3>
          <p>
            Suitability statements are commonly requested for: - Nursing
            graduate programs - Government and Council positions - Government
            health roles - Senior managerial positions ​ Often suitability
            statements will require you, as a jobseeker, to write detailed
            responses following a given word length / limit such as 500 words
            per question, 2 paragraphs per question or 1 page per question.
            Often you will be required to answer 2 to 3 questions on the
            suitability statement to explain how you demonstrate a specific set
            of skills and how you have engaged in a typical employment
            experience. The length of a suitability statement will commonly be
            between 2 or 3 pages. Please let us know what you require via
            sending our resume team an email.

          <p>
            When applying for positions within large organisations, government

            competent and experienced for the job. Selection criteria is

            criteria as part of a job application you may need to answer
            anywhere from 5 to 10 criteria. The word length of your responses
            may need to be from 150 words to 200 words to 500 words depending on
            the nursing position or nursing graduate program or construction job
            you are applying for. Therefore it is common that the response will
            need to be submitted as a separate document to your resume and cover
            letter.
