However, to achieve a permanent education or relief teaching role it is also a highly competitive industry for both new education graduates and experienced teachers applying for employment. At Exceptional Study Australia we offer a team of existing and experienced teachers and recruiters who specialise in writing education industry based resumes and employment applications. Our resumes are targeted at supporting teachers, trainers, educators and tutors within the education industry. Although many jobseekers may hold a certificate, diploma, advanced diploma, bachelor’s degree, master’s degree or PHD in an education related field it is vital that our jobseekers are effectively promoted in a detailed, honest and well-written manner in order to capture their love of education, their skills, their educational background, their experience history and every other important attribute they bring to the education industry.</p>     <p>As our teacher resume writers all come from an educational background, we understand the Australian education industry in all aspects from early childhood, to primary education, to secondary education, to the VET sector and the higher education/ university sector. Therefore, as a group of teachers with a passion for education and employment, we know and understand exactly what recruiters are seeking in a teacher or educational leadership role application. At Exceptional Study Australia it is our goal as resume writers to effectively frame you as a jobseeker to give you the greatest competitive advantage.</p>     <p>For both Australian and international jobseekers who are applying for any advertised and non-advertised education jobs in Australia, we offer the following professional job application services:</p><img src="/img/teacher-resumes-2.webp" alt="" />     <ul>      <li> Resumes </li>      <li>Cover letters </li>      <li>Answers to selection criteria </li>      <li>Answers to government suitability statements </li>      <li>LinkedIn profiles </li>     </ul>     <div class="split">      <div>       <h3> Teachers </h3>       <ul>        <li>Childcare Teachers / Educators </li>        <li>Early Childhood Teachers / Educators </li>        <li>Preschool Teachers </li>        <li>Kindergarten Teachers </li>        <li>Teacher Aides </li>        <li>Primary School Teachers </li>        <li>Secondary / High School Teachers </li>        <li>Relief Teachers </li>        <li>RTO College/ VET Sector Trainers </li>        <li>RTO College Teachers </li>        <li>RTO College Tutors </li>        <li>University Lecturers </li>        <li>University Tutors </li>       </ul>      </div>      <div>       <h3> Managers </h3>       <ul>        <li>Principals </li>        <li>Compliance Managers / Quality Managers </li>        <li>School Business Managers </li>        <li>International Recruitment Managers </li>        <li>International Education Marketing Managers </li>        <li>RTO College Managers </li>        <li>VET Sector Managers </li>       </ul>      </div>     </div>    </div><?php include '../shared/enquiries.html'; ?>   </div>   <div class="footer"><?php include '../shared/footer.html'; ?></div>  </div> </body><?php include '../shared/script.html'; ?> </html>
