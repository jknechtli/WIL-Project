          At Exceptional Study Australia we can help you with preparing your selection criteria answers for graduate jobs.

          Selection criteria are the skills, experience, knowledge and/or attributes an employer considers essential or desirable for an advertised position, such as a graduate program. To demonstrate equity and accountability, more and more employers are requiring applicants to address selection criteria in their applications. To do this, employers will use selection criteria to:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Shortlist applicants â€“ Only those who best meet the criteria will be interviewed.</li>
          <li>Enact equal employment opportunity requirements to ensure the best person gets the job.</li>
          <li>Demonstrate accountability </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Selection criteria may be incorporated into an application package, which typically includes: role identification, a job description, reporting relationships and responsibilities, and other information required. The package may also contain an application form.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are only required to provide responses to the selection criteria but you must answer each one individually.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider these questions:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Have you demonstrated particular skill/s in a similar job?</li>
          <li>Have you demonstrated this in voluntary work, work experience, community work or other activities?</li>
          <li>Have you gained a good knowledge of this through your degree?</li>
          <li>What have learnt in your career or studies have?</li>
          <li>What transferable skills do you have?</li>
          <li>How do you personally match the values or philosophy of the organisation you are targeting.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          At Exceptional Study Australia we can help you create valid and honest selection criteria responses for any graduate program, any internship or post university role you wish to apply for.
